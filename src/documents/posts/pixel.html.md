##Chromebook Pixel

<img src="/img/pixel.png" class="postimage">
When I first heard about the chromebook pixel I thought it was over priced and
not worth my attention. But the more I read about it and heard people reviewing
the machine the more I wanted it. I like the idea behind ChromeOS, a minimal OS
based on the world's best web browser. But as a developer I had a hard time
seeing myself using the machine for what I enjoy most, JavaScript development.
What ChromeOS lacked from my point of view was a package manager and full
featured shell. I only need one GUI app, chrome. But I need several command line
applications to be productive. I decided to give it a go and see if I could live
life as a developer on the pixel for 30 days. 

###Tools of the trade. 

I am a JavaScript developer and I need a bunch of command line tools and
applications to be productive. I know there are offerings to enable development
in "the cloud", but they just arent powerful enough yet for me to get any
meaningful work done. Here are some of the applications I will need to install
on the pixel to be productive. 

####Editor

  * [tmux (terminal multiplexer)](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/)
  * [vim (editor)](http://vim.org)
  * [irssi (irc client)](http://irssi.org)

####Server Side
  
  * [MongoDB (NoSQL Database)](http://mongodb.org)
  * [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)
  * [Go (golang tools)](http://golang.org)

#### Developer Utilities
  
  * [jshint](http://www.jshint.com)
  * [grunt](http://gruntjs.com)

###Objective

In this series of posts I am going to post tips, tutorials, and my struggles
with ChromeOS from a developer standpoint. I want to avoid dual booting and just
have access to my shell. I am going to try to release a web application using
only ChromeOS as the development platform. I will also go into details around
the apps that are offered by the Chrome Store and what the store seems to be
missing. Check back for updates and tutorials!
