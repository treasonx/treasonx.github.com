##Getting the News

<img src="/img/reader.png" width="200" style="float:left;">
Last night while "reading the internet", which is what I tell my wife I am doing when in google reader. I hit a headline that felt like a ton of bricks. Google is killing off GoogleReader. I was shocked, I thought to myself this must be a joke. But it was true the app that I have used religiously for the past 8 years was being put down. 

It was like being told my beloved pet of the last 8 years was on his last leg and only had a few months left. At first I was outraged how could google do this to me! The company I respect the most for improving my life more than any other has just fucked me! I wanted to take a shit in my chromebook and set it straight back to moutain view! Bastards! 

But this is part of a larger trend on the internet. Most people just dont consume information the way I do. I am in the minority, most regular people get their news from social networks like twitter, facebook, or Google+. For me that isnt enough, I need a way to condense my most favorite websites down into something that is quick to consume and filter. For me that service was google reader. I could easily speed through hundreds of posts from various sites across the internet and filter out the
fluff and keep the gold. From technical news, to comics and even animated gifs reader was my claim on the internet information gold mine.

This isnt surprising news I have felt that google reader might be on the chopping block soon. With google's obvious push into social with Google+. I knew it was only a matter of time. But when they started to add small Google+ integrations into Reader I was hopeful. But not anymore. 

The death of GoogleReader is going to leave a huge hole in my day to day internet usage. I will need to fill that hole and I am excited to see what the hackers will put together on the web. In the mean time I have learned that if something is this important to your work flow you need to own it. So I am going to set out on a new project, something that will fit how I consume information on the internet. With the death of GoogleReader I am left with a serious itch that needs to be scratched.
